# MachineLearning23

This repository is part of the master course Biomedical Information Technology for the module Machine Learning. 

Here, various tasks are developed based on the book "Deep Learning with Pytorch". 
It is expected that there will also be an individual project by the end of the semester.


To test the code of an exercise, please download the whole exercise-folder. 
The documents inside the folder must be at the same file path as the Jupiter notebook in order to run it without any issues.
